🔹 1. Payment APIs (Razorpay, PayPal, Stripe, UPI)

Where used: E-commerce checkout (Flipkart, Swiggy, Amazon).
When you click “Pay Now”, the app calls Razorpay’s API.
API handles payment verification, bank processing, success/failure response.

Flow:
App sends payment details → Razorpay API.
Razorpay talks to your bank.
API responds → "Payment Success" or "Failed".
👉 You don’t need to build a bank system, just plug in Razorpay’s API.

🔹 2. Maps & Location APIs (Google Maps, Mapbox)

Where used: Ola, Uber, Zomato, Swiggy.
App sends pickup & drop coordinates to Google Maps API.
API responds with distance, ETA, best routes.

Flow:
App calls Google Maps API → “Give me route between A and B.”
API responds with directions + traffic data.

🔹 3. Social Media APIs (Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

Where used: Social sharing, login with Google/Facebook.
Example: A blog lets you “Login with Google.”
Your app doesn’t store your password — instead, it uses Google’s OAuth API to confirm your identity.

Flow:
User clicks “Login with Google.”
Google API checks credentials.
Google API responds with a secure token → app knows you’re verified.

🔹 4. Messaging APIs (Twilio, WhatsApp Business API)

Where used: OTP verification, notifications.
Example: Amazon sends an OTP → uses SMS/WhatsApp API (like Twilio).

Flow:

App sends phone number + OTP → Twilio API.
Twilio delivers SMS to your phone.
API responds with delivery status.

🔹 5. Weather APIs (OpenWeather, AccuWeather)

Where used: Weather apps, airlines, farming apps
Example: Google Weather widget fetches data from an API.

Flow:
App requests weather for Delhi.
API sends JSON → { "temp": 32°C, "condition": "Cloudy" }.

🔹 6. E-commerce APIs (Amazon Product Advertising API, Shopify API)

Where used: Price comparison sites, affiliate marketing.
Example: A website shows Amazon product prices without hosting data.
It just calls Amazon’s API.

Flow:
Request → “Give me details of iPhone 15.”
API responds → product name, price, image.

🔹 7. Entertainment APIs (Spotify, YouTube, Netflix)

Where used: Music apps, video apps.
Example: Spotify recommends songs using its API.
YouTube’s API lets other apps embed videos.

Flow:
App sends request → “Search songs with keyword Arijit Singh.”
API responds with list of songs in JSON.

✅ In short:

APIs are connectors between apps and external services.
Instead of building everything from scratch, companies use APIs (Payments, Maps, Messaging, Weather, etc.).
