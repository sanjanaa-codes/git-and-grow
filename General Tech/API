An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu in a restaurant:

The restaurant (software/system) has a kitchen (internal logic, database, functions) where the food is prepared.
The menu (API) tells you what you can order (what services/functions the system provides) and how to ask for them.
You donâ€™t need to know how the food is cooked (internal code) â€” you just place the order using the menu (API request), and the kitchen serves the dish (API response).

In short:
ðŸ‘‰ API is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and share data with each other.

Example:
Google Maps API lets a cab app show live maps without building its own maps system.
Payment Gateway API (like Razorpay or PayPal) allows apps to process payments securely.
